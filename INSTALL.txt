    No other Zope products are required, though Core Session Tracking
    can be used with Formulator if available:

  Upgrading

    to 0.9.2 from earlier versions 

      There should be no significant upgrade problems; your forms
      should still work.

    to 0.9.1 from earlier versions

      There should be no significant upgrade problems; your forms
      should still work.

  Quickstart

    Formulator follows the normal Zope filesystem product installation
    procedure; just unpack the tarball to your products directory and
    restart Zope.

    Now the same at a more leisurely pace.

  Unpacking

    Formulator comes as a 'Formulator-x.x.tgz' file, where 'x.x'
    stands for the Formulator version number. On Unix, you can use::

      tar xvzf Formulator-x.x.tgz 

    to unpack the file. On Windows you can use your favorite archiving
    software, such as WinZip.

    This will create a Formulator directory. 

  Installing the Product 

    Move this directory to your Zope's Products directory. Normally
    this is 'yourzope/lib/python/Products'. 

    Now restart your Zope.

  Verifying Installation

    If all went well, Formulator should now be visible in Zope in the
    Products screen ('/Control_Panel/Products'). In a Zope folder, you
    should now see a 'Formulator Form' in your 'Add' list. You should
    be able to add a form to a folder now.
