Installing Formulator

  Requirements

    Formulator requires Zope versions 2.3 or higher:

      http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope

    My development Zope is now Zope 2.4 however, and I plan to require
    Zope 2.4 in the future.

    No other Zope products are required, though Zope Page Templates
    are recommended, to enable the TALES tab:

    Core Session Tracking can also be used with Formulator if
    available:

    Once Zope 2.5 is released, both these products should become part
    of the Zope distribution.

  Upgrading

    to 1.0.9 from earlier versions

      There should be no problems. If you're upgrading from 0.9.2 or 
      below however, please see the upgrading note for 0.9.3. Do note
      that the Override tab is scheduled to be phased out eventually in 
      favor of the TALES tab. This will take a while yet, though.

    to 1.0.1 from earlier versions

      There should be no problems. If you're upgrading from 0.9.2 or
      below, please see the upgrading note for 0.9.3.

    to 1.0 from earlier versions

      There should be no problems. If you're upgrading from 0.9.2 or
      below, please see the upgrading note for 0.9.3.

    to 0.9.5 from earlier versions
 
      There should be no problems in upgrading from 0.9.4 or 0.9.3.
      If you're upgrading from 0.9.2 or below, see the upgrading note
      for 0.9.3.

    to 0.9.4 from earlier versions

      There should be no problems in upgrading from 0.9.3.

      If you're upgrading from 0.9.2 or below, see the upgrading
      note for 0.9.3.

    to 0.9.3 from earlier versions
     
      'items_method' in ListField is gone; you'll have to adjust make
      your forms use 'items' in the override tab now instead. Sorry
      about that, it *was* marked experimental. :)

      There should be no other problems in upgrading.

    to 0.9.2 from earlier versions 

      There should be no significant upgrade problems; your forms
      should still work. RangedIntegerFields should show up as
      IntegerFields, which subsume their functionality.

    to 0.9.1 from earlier versions

      There should be no significant upgrade problems; your forms
      should still work.

  Quickstart

    Formulator follows the normal Zope filesystem product installation
    procedure; just unpack the tarball to your products directory and
    restart Zope.

    Now the same at a more leisurely pace.

  Unpacking

    Formulator comes as a 'Formulator-x.x.tgz' file, where 'x.x'
    stands for the Formulator version number. On Unix, you can use::

      tar xvzf Formulator-x.x.tgz 

    to unpack the file. On Windows you can use your favorite archiving
    software, such as WinZip.

    This will create a Formulator directory. 

  Installing the Product 

    Move this directory to your Zope's Products directory. Normally
    this is 'yourzope/lib/python/Products'. 

    Now restart your Zope.

  Verifying Installation

    If all went well, Formulator should now be visible in Zope in the
    Products screen ('/Control_Panel/Products'). In a Zope folder, you
    should now see a 'Formulator Form' in your 'Add' list. You should
    be able to add a form to a folder now.
