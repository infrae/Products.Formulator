Formulator Form - Settings

  Description

    You can set some basic settings of the form. Not much is here yet.

  Groups in row (order tab)

    Change the amount of groups that should appear in a single row
    in the 'order' view. The default is '4'.

  Upgrade

    The 'Upgrade' button in this section is really not useful yet.
    It's used internally to upgrade unreleased development versions of
    Formulator to the current version. Perhaps this will become more
    useful in the future.
