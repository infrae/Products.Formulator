  0.9.1

    Features Added

      - Widgets now have a 'hidden' property. If set, the widget is
        drawn as a 'hidden' field. 'hidden' fields do get validated
        normally, however.
 
      - Changed API of Widget and Validator slightly; render() and
        validate() methods now take an extra 'key' argument indicating
        the name the field should have in the form. This is necessarily
        to handle sub fields of composite fields.

      - Added EmailField and FloatField.
 
      - Added some infrastructure to support 'composite fields'; fields 
        composed out of multiple sub fields.

      - Added DateTimeField, the first example of a composite field
        (field made of other fields).

    Bugs Fixed  

      - General code cleanups; removed some unused methods.

      - Fixed security assertion for validate_all_to_request() method.

      - MethodFields now check whether they have 'View' permission to
        execute listed Python Script or DTML Method.

      - RangedInteger is now < end, instead of <=, compatible with the
        documentation.
