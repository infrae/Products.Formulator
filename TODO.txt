Formulator TODO

  - Make composite fields work well as hidden fields.

  - Add combobox field

  - Add various button fields

  - Investigate duration and time only field.

  - internationalisation (or error messages first)

  - HTML filtering field?

  - Add render_view() to widgets, so that fields can be displayed
    view-only.

  - Add unit tests!

  - Fix restart 'Installed product Formulator by Zope' spurious transaction
    weirdness. A debugging run shows that this message is generated
    by all products, so why does only Formulator show up each time we
    restart?
